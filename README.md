# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project was a part of my Master Degree's first year, 
I used Rstudio to create a Machine Learning model that predicts breast cancer from biomarkers.

For the prediction i used many algorithms :
- random forest classifier
- k nearest neighbor 
- Support-vector machine
